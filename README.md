In this repository, there will be multiple C programs that do basic tasks.
So far, we have 2 directories inside our repository: 
1- 0x00-Hello_World
2- 0x01-Variables_If_Else_While

You can open each of these directories one by one and you will be able to see what each program on these directories does exactly.
